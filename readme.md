A discord leveling, custom games, and other utilities bot for german guilds.

pls don't host this bot yourself, you can use it as reference for creating your own(probably shuoldn't i got no clue about c#), 
and for a lot of the features you need my other infrastructure of which not everything is open source and takes some effort to set up.

env variables:

BOTTOKEN : discord bot token

DBNAME: Database Name

DBSTRING: Mongodb Connection String

CDN_API_KEY: cdn.jmp.blue api key

GOOGLE_API_KEY: google api key

LAVALINK: lavalink password
